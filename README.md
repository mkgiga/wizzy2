## Overview

Wizzy2 is a visual editor HTML/CSS webpages that allows for developers already familiar with HTML/CSS to rapidly prototype and design user interfaces that can be exported and used in any web project.

## Motivation

There are few tools that allow you to visually edit pages in a way that is intuitive when simply writing it by hand is faster and easier. I aim to bridge that gap by accommodating the user that is already familiar with HTML/CSS instead of trying to abstract it away and make it more 'user-friendly'. A couple of examples of this may be:

- Setting specific CSS properties by pressing keys in a specific sequence, i.e. `S -> M -> T -> A` to set the `margin-top` of an element to `auto`. or `S -> M -> T -> ‚Üë -> ‚Üë -> ‚Üë -> ‚Üë ... ` to increment the `margin-top` by some amount. These types of shortcuts are calld "chords" and are common in text editors like Vim or Emacs. `S` stands for style, `M` for margin, `T` for top, and so on.

- Just editing the HTML directly in the page rather than using massive set of buttons and dropdowns to do the same thing. Now you're doing what you would normally do, except you get instant visual feedback.

## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

- _What happened to wizzy 1?_

  The first iteration of wizzy was a simple project that I never released publicly. It ended up being more of a proof of concept, which I scrapped so I could start fresh with a new codebase

- _Why is this project called wizzy?_

  The name "wizzy" is a portmanteau of "wizard", "busy" and the long acronym "WYSIWYG" which stands for "What You See Is What You Get", which refers to any editor that shows the user the end-result of their work as they are working on it, such as Microsoft Word or Adobe Photoshop.

- _Where can I find the source code?_

  Right here dummy üòÑ Look at the top of the page!

- _Can I use this project in my own project?_

  Yes! This project is licensed under the [MIT License](#license), which means you can use it in your own projects, commercial or otherwise, as long as you include the license with your project. It's not required, but I would be very happy if you included a link to this project in your project's acknowledgements or credits.
