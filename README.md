## Overview

There are few tools available that succeed in providing a fast and intuitive way to create and iterate on web interfaces. In the past, tools like Adobe Dreamweaver and Microsoft Frontpage have tried to provide a visual interface for web development -- These tools often go out of their way to accommodate both developers and non-developers alike, and as a result, their interfaces are often described as cluttered and may overload the user with too many options, creating a sort of web-development equivalent to a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) like FL Studio or Ableton Live. These tools are valuable in their field, but should not be the standard for a visual web development experience.

## Current priorities

- [ ] Visual feedback on chord presses to see what action is being performed and what you can press next
- [x] Chord-based hotkeys for common actions (T -> A -> ArrowUp) = text-align: center
- [x] Basic HTML/CSS inline editor
- [x] Attributes/classes/inline style editor per-element
- [ ] Quick styles menu on selection per-element (Alignment, padding, margin, etc.)
- [x] Preferences menu
- [ ] Quick color picker

## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

- _What happened to wizzy 1?_

  The first iteration of wizzy was a simple project that I never released publicly. It ended up being more of a proof of concept, which I scrapped so I could start fresh with a new codebase

- _Why is this project called wizzy?_

  The name "wizzy" is a portmanteau of "wizard", "busy" and the long acronym "WYSIWYG" which stands for "What You See Is What You Get", which refers to any editor that shows the user the end-result of their work as they are working on it, such as Microsoft Word or Adobe Photoshop.

- _Where can I find the source code?_

  Right here dummy üòÑ Look at the top of the page!

- _Can I use this project in my own project?_

  Yes! This project is licensed under the [MIT License](#license), which means you can use it in your own projects, commercial or otherwise, as long as you include the license with your project. It's not required, but I would be very happy if you included a link to this project in your project's acknowledgements or credits.
